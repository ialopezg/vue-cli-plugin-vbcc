# @ialopezg/vue-cli-plugin-vbcc

Vue-BCC plugin for `@vue/cli` >= 3.0.

### Install

First you need to install `@vue/cli` globally (follow the instructions [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/)).

Then create a project and add the Element plugin:

```bash
vue create my-app
cd my-app
vue add element
```

You'll be asked some questions regarding how VBCC is configured in your project. After that, you're good to go.
